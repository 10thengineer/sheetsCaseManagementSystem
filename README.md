# sheetsCaseManagmentSystem
I'm volunteering for a homeless shelter, and the social worker there wanted a simple case management system for them to manage their clients there. There are professional case management systems, but for those who cannot afford those subscription based programs, this is meant to be a type of transition software until they are able to get a better case management system should they need it. This is focused on functioning for smaller organizations and uses Google Sheets along with the Google Apps Script interface in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS languages.

As of 11/6/2020, only the adding new profiles is functional. A search and edit option will be added soon. 

I heavily referenced this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsIuSwSj3CM&list=PLF6j-ODSXgCMm2zIdswoxq9XeVUGjEcAJ&index=32&t=36s made by Learn Google Spreadsheets as well as https://materializecss.com/ for their prebuilt HTML and CSS elements. Make sure to check their stuff out and support them! Thanks!

Instructions:

1. Open a new Google Sheets file.
2. Click on Tools> script editor to open the Google Apps Script interface
3. Copy and paste the code from the databaseFunctions file here to the default opening file.
4. Save the file.
5. Click on File> New > HTML file.
6. Copy and paste the code from the databaseInterface file here to the new HTML file.
7. Save the file.

There should now be a new menu option that will activate the database interface at the top.
