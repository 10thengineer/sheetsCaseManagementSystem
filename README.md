# sheetsCaseManagmentSystem
I'm volunteering for a homeless shelter, and the social worker there wanted a simple case management system for them to manage their clients there. There are professional case management systems, but for those who cannot afford those subscription based programs, this is meant to be a type of transition software until they are able to get a better case management system should they need it. This is focused on functioning for smaller organizations and uses Google Sheets along with the Google Apps Script interface in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS languages.
